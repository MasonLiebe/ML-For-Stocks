    "# Q-Learning Agent for Stock Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "This Q-learning agent is designed to make stock trading decisions based on historical price data. The agent learns an optimal trading strategy through interaction with the market environment using the Q-learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Agent Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent consists of a deep neural network that takes in a state representation and outputs Q-values for each possible action. The state is represented by a sliding window of price differences over a specified window size. The neural network architecture includes an input layer, a hidden layer with ReLU activation, and an output layer with linear activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q-Learning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-learning process follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The agent's neural network is initialized with random weights, and the replay memory is emptied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **State Representation**: At each time step, the agent observes the current state of the market, which is represented by a sliding window of price differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Action Selection**: The agent selects an action (buy, sell, or hold) based on an epsilon-greedy policy. With probability epsilon, the agent explores by selecting a random action, and with probability 1-epsilon, the agent exploits by selecting the action with the highest Q-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **State Transition**: The agent executes the selected action and observes the next state and the reward received from the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Replay Memory**: The agent stores the transition (state, action, reward, next state, done) in the replay memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Q-Value Update**: The agent samples a batch of transitions from the replay memory and updates the Q-values using the Q-learning update rule. The target Q-value for each transition is calculated based on the reward and the maximum Q-value of the next state.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Neural Network Update**: The agent's neural network is updated using the sampled batch of transitions and the Q-learning loss function. The optimizer adjusts the network's weights to minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Iteration**: Steps 3-7 are repeated for a specified number of episodes or until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "The trading simulation is performed using the trained Q-learning agent. The agent makes buy and sell decisions based on the current state of the market. The state is represented by a sliding window of price differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent's decisions are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Buy**: If the agent selects the buy action and there is sufficient funds, a unit of stock is purchased, and the inventory and balance are updated accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sell**: If the agent selects the sell action and there is stock in the inventory, a unit of stock is sold, and the balance is updated based on the selling price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hold**: If the agent selects the hold action, no action is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation keeps track of the buying and selling states, total gains, investment percentage, and the number of shares held at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Q-learning agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the historical price data as a list of closing prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set the initial parameters, such as the initial money, window size, and skip size.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create an instance of the `Agent` class with the desired state size, window size, trend, skip size, batch size, and device.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Call the `train` method to train the agent for a specified number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Evaluate the agent's performance using the `buy` method, which returns the buy and sell states, total gains, investment percentage, and the number of shares held.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q-learning agent provides a reinforcement learning approach to optimize a trading strategy based on historical price data. By interacting with the market environment and learning from its experiences, the agent aims to make profitable trading decisions."
